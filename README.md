# Star Trek: Brawl

This is a simple RPG game in which the player chooses their character and then fights the rest of the characters in the order of their choosing. It's possible to win and lose with every character.

## About this Game

Game accessible [here](https://kathdovi.github.io/unit-4-game/).

### Playing the Game

The user starts by choosing their main character. Then, they are prompted to choose their first opponent. The opponents attack at different strengths, with those with higher HPs having higher attacks. After defeating one opponent, the user chooses another until all opponents are defeated. If at any point a player's HP drops to 0 or below, the game is over and the player loses. To win, the player must defeat all three remaining opponents without their HP falling to 0 or below.
In the case of a win or loss of the game, the player can play again by pressing the reset button.

### Strategy

Because there is no way to heal, the only way to win the game is to choose your opponents in the correct order. There are different strategies for different characters: some characters necessitate fighting the weaker opponents before the stronger opponents, and some characters necessitate the opposite.
